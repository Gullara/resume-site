                <h2>Warman Home Center Invoice Tracking Program</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I and a team of five individuals have been working on a project for 
                    Warman Homes Center since September 2013. We were tasked with creating 
                    a desktop application that would help them to track their invoices. 
                    The project is currently ongoing, due to be delivered at the end of 
                    April 2014. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The main function of the program is to keep track of each invoice’s 
                    current status in Warman Homes’ delivery process. The invoice starts 
                    with the status of pending when it is entered into the program and it 
                    is tracked until it reaches the status of complete. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Another function of the application is to allow quick access to each 
                    order’s information without having to locate the physical paper invoice. 
                    Each invoice has important information such as the address and delivery 
                    date stored in the program. Search functionality allows the user to 
                    find a particular invoice or group of invoices very easily. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The program also tracks customers, their individual shipping locations, 
                    and the company’s own employees. As they pertain to the orders. These 
                    different objects can be added, updated, and removed as needed.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The application creates a log of completed orders for each day. These 
                    can be viewed to review past orders and easily printed to be stored 
                    physically elsewhere.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The application has two main views. One is for the company’s shipper, 
                    which is where most of the program’s management is done, and another 
                    is a view where the company’s salespeople can view the invoices.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The project provided a valuable opportunity to work with a client. 
                    We work closely with them to ensure their needs are met. They are 
                    provided with regular updates on our progress and we are quick to 
                    respond to their feedback. For me it has been an excellent experience 
                    and I think our clients at Warman Homes Center are happy with our work.
                </p>
